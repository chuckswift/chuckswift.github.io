<p>Wire-Feed
Inexpensive wire-feed machines use a spool of hollow, flux-cored wire that feeds out automatically. Originally developed for welding outdoors at windy construction sites, wire-feed welding is ideal for beginners trying to complete projects around the house.
</p>

<p>TIG Welding
Instead of a consumable electrode, which conducts current and melts into the metal, a TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) machine has a nonconsumable tungsten electrode to strike the arc and establish the puddle of molten metal. A separate filler rod, held in the welder's other hand, is added to fill the puddle.
</p>

<p>MIG Welding
Use a solid-core filler wire, surround it with an inert gas like argon or CO2, and your wire-feed welder becomes a MIG machine (Metal Inert Gas). It leaves a cleaner, slag-free weld and can be used on stainless steel or aluminum.
</p>

<p>Stick Welding
A flux-coated metal electrode that melts into the puddle and fills the bead is faster for welding thicker pieces. But stick welding is overkill for a lot of household projects, and it takes practice to do it well.
